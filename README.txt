Banking System : Data flow graphs

Github Repo: https://github.com/yashrtalele/BankingSystem

Source code description: Our code models a banking system with classes for customers, accounts, and transactions. It supports creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing funds, applying and getting loans, and recording transaction histories.

For our project we have used Data flow graph analysis for our source code. The test-suites are in the BankingSystemTestSuites.java. We used JUnit to test our code.

We generated all possible du-paths using java-parser and all the du-paths are added in a text file under documentation/manual-test-case-designs. Repo link: https://github.com/yashrtalele/DefUseAnalysis/

All the manual test case design are in the folder documentation/manual-test-case-designs.
They are designed specifically for each class we have for testing.

Test-reports are in documentation/test-report.
